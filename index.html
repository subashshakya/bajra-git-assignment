              for manipulation of the game enviroment. There is feature of
              keeping the current score and all time best as well. In this

              This project was given to us as the final assignment for the

              functionality as specified by the requirements document of the
              <strong>road racer</strong> game. We can shoot bullets to the
              enemy cars and the obstacles on the road to get points. Coins are
              earned by colliding with the coin object on the road. The game
              instructions are clearly mentioned on the right side of the game
              for convenience. This game further enhanced my understanding on
              the javascript language and development of overall better problem
              solving and logical understanding.
